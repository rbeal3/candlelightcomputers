<p> How do I learn about how my device works?  </p>
<p> step 0) If you are REALLY afraid of messing things up you may want to backup any data on the device. But you should know, It's basically impossible for a normal user to damage your device, or erase data as long as you read what you're doing. Any operation that will do something drastic will ask for confirmation first</p>
<p> step 1) explore. Change as much as you can. Modify every setting, and see what happens. Don't be skiddish here. The only other way to figure it out is to read some documentation, which most users are not willing to do.  </p>
<p> step 2) Research things you didn't understand using your new best friend (google search).  </p>
<p> step 3) Look for other cool features, by asking questions about what you know, and looking for things you think SHOULD be features. Odds are there is an app, or a program that does exactly what you want. But please be careful, and read this download guide HERE </p>
